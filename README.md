# MCMiniGames

A modular Bukkit plugin for Minecraft that hosts multiple competitive minigames including Hunters vs Speedrunners, Deathswap, and Random Item PvP â€” all built from scratch to avoid relying on third-party plugins.

Features:
- Custom game modes with isolated logic and lifecycle management
- GameType registry system for easy extension and maintenance
- Robust event handling using Bukkit's EventHandler system
- Team assignment and disconnect handling for smooth multiplayer sessions
- Singleton plugin core with clearly structured interfaces and initialization logic

This project was developed in Java to improve backend architecture skills, while solving real-world issues like player disconnections and plugin extensibility. Ideal for personal Minecraft servers or as a foundation for custom game logic.
